## About

CUDA implementation of stream compaction & scan.

## Performance Analysis

### Block Size

For all kernels, I found that 128 was the optimal block size.

### Time vs. Array Size

| Array Size | CPU Scan | Naive Scan | Work-Efficient Scan | Thrust Scan | CPU Compact | Work-Efficient Compact |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| 2^8        | 0.000333 | 0.0806 | 0.0963 | 0.0522 | 0.000834 | 0.125 |
| 2^12 | 0.00235 | 0.0840 | 0.109 | 0.0543 | 0.00924 | 0.108 |
| 2^16 | 0.0388 | 0.0820 | 0.120 | 0.0522 | 0.145 | 0.107 |
| 2^20 | 0.541 | 0.503 | 0.533 | 0.194 | 2.42 | 0.726 |
| 2^24 | 9.033 | 11.134 | 7.661 | 0.500 | 38.880 | 8.487 |

## What is going on here?

Unoptimized GPU scanning actually performs worse than CPU scanning. A bit of Nsight shows that the kernels have low warp occupancy (esp. up / down sweeps):

The hypothesis here is that the kernels are being bottlenecked by global memory access and warp divergence.
